    <h1>133. Eevee</h1>
<p>Eevee are of great interest to scientists and are the target of much study. Researchers often keep Eevee as pets and generally do not experiment on them due to the attachment they feel towards this Pokemon. Some Eevee can be trained to switch between their basic stage and all other stages of evolution at will, based on the circumstance. Only Eevee belonging to very skilled trainers can achieve this.</p>
 <p>Eevee is a mammalian creature with brown fur, a bushy tail that has a cream-colored tip, and a large furry collar that is also cream-colored. Eevee's behavior can be affected by its surroundings. Eventually, with enough alteration, the Eevee may evolve to better suit its surroundings. Eevee are quite rare in the wild. They sometimes live near cities and towns. It is possible for Eevee to live almost anywhere. </p>

    <h1>134. Vaporeon <ul id="skyline">
    <li id="panel1b"></li></ul></h1>
    <p>Its cell composition is similar to water molecules. As a result, it can’t be seen when it melts away into water. They can also manipulate water molecules, giving them the ability to learn Water-type attacks their previous evolution could not. Vaporeon also have the ability to walk on water. Vaporeon can also glide in the air for moments because of its fins. </p> <p>Vaporeon are very difficult to observe in the wild, as they are quite rare. When they are in the water, they are virtually impossible to see. While they are much easier to see while they are resting onshore, they possess the ability to rearrange themselves on a molecular level, causing themselves to "melt" into the water. It is likely that many mermaid stories were spawned by Vaporeon sightings, as their tails resemble those of mermaids. When Vaporeon's fins begin to vibrate, it is said to be a sign that rain will come within a few hours.
Vaporeon are always found close to water, and prefer large, clean lakes. It is found in the same regions that Eevee can be found in.

    <h1>135. Jolteon <ul id="skyline">
    <li id="panel2b"></li></ul></h1>
    <p>Jolteon are often kept as pets by electricians and electrical engineers. This Pokemon is usually found assisting its handler by sniffing out problems in wiring or in large motors. Some Jolteon enjoy starting these motors as a way of training themselves. In the past, Jolteon were often used to electrocute and set fire to wooden ships during wars. The practice was short lived however, since Jolteon's emotional instability would sometimes cause it to fight those on its own side of the war.</p><p>Jolteon are sensitive Pokémon and easily become sad or angry. Every time its mood changes, it charges power. If startled or angered, it can shoot out bristles that are sharp enough to pierce opponents. Every hair on its body starts to stand sharply on end if it becomes charged with electricity, and the negatively charged ions in its fur create a constant sparking noise. Its fur also stands on end if it is angry or startled.</p>
<p>Jolteon usually are found near power plants. Due to the need of a Thunderstone to evolve from Eevee, not many are found. </p>

    <h1>136. Flareon <ul id="skyline">
    <li id="panel3b"></li></ul></h1>
<p>Flareon are very dangerous and known to cause house fires if not watched closely. Even so, candle makers and glass blowers like to have them around to conserve power and cut costs associated with their livelihood. As a general rule, firemen and arson investigators always question owners of Flareon first in the event of large fires, whether they be in a neighborhood or a nearby forest. Because of this stereotyping, Flareon can be very shy around people they don't know and their trainers guard them jealously.</p><p>Flareon fluffs out its fur collar to cool down its body temperature, which can reach 1,650°F. Flareon is capable of using physical attacks just as well as its special attacks due to its high Attackstat. Flareon can use most of the moves that Eevee is capable of using, but it can also shoot powerful flames that have been known to reach a maximum of 3,100°F, as the air it inhales is ignited by a flame in its body and is expelled as fire.</p>
<p>Flareon are mainly found in hot places, but only rarely, as an Eevee needs to be exposed to a Fire Stone to evolve.</p>

    <h1>196. Espeon <ul id="skyline">
    <li id="panel4b"></li></ul></h1>
<p>Espeon are very good pets for young children. Generally speaking, they are acquired by the family that takes care of them as Eevee and then evolve into Espeon in the following months due to the affection that children shower upon them. Espeon are banned from being taken to school since they can read teachers' minds and assist their young charge on tests. Espeon are also barred from most sporting events for this same reason.</p><p>Espeon has developed psychic powers due to a combination of great loyalty to its Trainer and sunlight, with several signature special abilities attributable to its fine, sensitive fur. This very fine fur, which has the look and feel of velvet, is so sensitive, that as air currents pass through it, Espeon is able to sense things such as minute shifts in the air, and predict changes in the weather or the opponent's next move. Espeon are very loyal to their Trainers and will protect them from harm. They enjoy basking in full sunlight. The tip of its forked tail quivers when it is predicting its opponent's next move. Espeon are usually found in areas that receive a lot of light, or, more commonly under the care of people.

    <h1>197. Umbreon <ul id="skyline">
    <li id="panel5b"></li></ul></h1>
<p>Umbreon are generally trained by people with insomnia or those whose job involves staying up late at night, such as security guards and some computer programmers. Many security firms maintain entire teams of Umbreon to patrol their grounds. This plays into Umbreon's strengths as they are good at disabling intruders and generally don't trust strangers. If one ever were to cross a wild Umbreon, best practice tends to be immediate flight, rather than a battle.</p><p>Umbreon can spray a poisonous sweat whenever it gets agitated. Its golden bands glow. When exposed to the moon's aura, the rings on its body glaow faintly and it's filled with a mysterious power.</p>
<p>Umbreon stalks prey silently at night. As it awaits its victims' approach, the yellow rings on its body begin to glow. During the day, they blink on and off. They are often seen on roofs and in trees staring at the moon. Umbreon are normally found in dark areas such as thick forests, but are most commonly found under the care of people.</p>

    <h1>470. Leafeon <ul id="skyline">
    <li id="panel6b"></li></ul></h1>
<p>Leafeon are known to be some of the most docile Pokemon in existence. They make great companions for gardeners and forest rangers. Leafeon can sense whether or not a person is trustworthy, and some wild Leafeon will introduce themselves to a trainer and be inseparable from that point forward. Old stories often reference Leafeon as fairies of some kind and also tell of wilderness explorers who kept Leafeon by their side for fifty years or more. Though generally very calm, a startled Leafeon may inadvertently level small patches of the forest with its solar beam if it has absorbed enough sunlight.</p><p>It is pacifistic, preferring to obtain food with photosynthesis than competing with other Pokémon and foraging.
As an Eevee, it chooses to live anywhere it wants. From there, it can evolve to its surroundings. In this case, Eevee has lived in a forest and evolved into Leafeon.

    <li id="panel7b"></li></ul></h1>
<p>Glaceon are among the best rescue Pokemon yet discovered. Mountaineers and winter sports enthusiasts like to carry them in case of emergency. Studies have shown that climbers accompanied by Glaceon triple their chances of having a safe journey. Wild Glaceon are known to defend their territory by causing avalanches, and will also use this technique to hunt. Well trained Glaceon can use avalanches to surf down mountainsides, and this ability has created a sporting event that is popular in cold climates.</p><p>Glaceon can use any attack that Eevee knows with the addition of Ice-type moves. As a fully evolved Pokémon, Glaceon can learn Hyper Beamand Giga Impact. In addition to that, it can also freeze its fur to make it stand up like needles - similar to its evolutionary kin, Jolteon. By controlling its body heat, it can also freeze the atmosphere around it to make a diamond-dust flurry.
<p>As an Eevee, it chooses to live anywhere it wants. From there, it can evolve to its surroundings. In this case, an Eevee living in snowy mountains can evolve into a Glaceon.
